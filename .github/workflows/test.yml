      # Failure behavior
      # 1. When all steps above have completed successfully, begin test execution
      # 2. When failure occurs, then indicate the failure in the associated PR checker
      # 3. Do NOT halt test execution (i.e. proceed if possible)
      # Note: In order to support failure behavior 3 above, the always() status function
      # appears below to avoid the default, which is success().
